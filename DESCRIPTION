Description: RMA (implemented in the affy package) works on a list of CEL files. Normalization is done using
  a model derived from the CEL files. However, changing the list of CEL files changes the model and hence
  the expression estimates.  This package calculates the model in such a way that it can be applied to
  new data without changing. There are several approaches, including fRMA and refRMA, that implement this
  idea. This package was based on fRMA/fRMATools but added a few new features needed for a specific project.
